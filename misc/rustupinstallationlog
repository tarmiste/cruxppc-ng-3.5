info: downloading installer

Welcome to Rust!

This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

It will add the cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /root/.cargo/bin

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /root/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile file located at:

  /root/.profile

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:


   default host triple: powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu
     default toolchain: stable
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation

I'm going to ask you the value of each of these installation options.
You may simply press the Enter key to leave unchanged.

Default host triple?


Default toolchain? (stable/beta/nightly/none)


Profile (which tools and data to install)? (minimal/default/complete)


Modify PATH variable? (y/n)

  stable installed - rustc 1.39.0 (4560ea788 2019-11-04)


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you need Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin) in your PATH
environment variable. Next time you log in this will be done
automatically.

To configure your current shell run source $HOME/.cargo/env
